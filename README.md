Complete rumor script with ChatGPT, which allows placing an NPC to spread rumors rewritten based on user input. You can adjust numerous parameters in the Config.lua file, such as NPCs, rumor price, duration, quantity, etc. This rumor system operates differently from what you see elsewhere because it is integrated with ChatGPT OPENAI. You'll need a paid account to use it as it will rephrase your rumors in a western style. Each NPC will communicate a different phrase.

To configure in your server.cfg:
set openai_api_key "yourkey" # https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
